/**
 These tests measure the most important performance characteristics of the library. They are in the sample app tests because you cannot run library tests on a device.

 All of the tests are run on the simulator and an iPhone 6 Plus.

 NOTES

 - Major performance improvement was not merging dictionaries when adding to the manager and not using inout. Instead, the dictionaries and arrays were boxed in a class.
 - Possible future improvement - use an NSSet for the listeners instead of arrays. This cannot be implemented in swift because the listeners aren't hashable (but they actually are because of inter-op). It would need to be a weak set though. Perhaps it could be used as an intermediate data structure (or just write a NSWeakSet).
